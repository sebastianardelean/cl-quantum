* Cl-Quantum 

** Usage

*cl-quantum* is a package that allows the definition and development of quantum circuits in Common Lisp and to export them to *OpenQASM v2.0*.

The following code presents an example that initializes a quantum circuit made of one 2-qubits quantum register and one 2-bits classical register.
We apply on the circuit Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z and CNOT gates.

#+begin_src lisp
  (defvar qreg (make-qregister 2 "q"))
  (defvar creg (make-cregister 2 "c"))
  (defvar qc (make-qcircuit qreg creg))
  (hgate qc 0)
  (xgate qc 1)
  (ygate qc 0)
  (zgate qc 1)
  (cnotgate qc 0 1)
  (measure qc 0 1)

#+end_src 

To generate the *OpenQASM v2.0* is enough to call the function ~(create-openqasm qc "")~, thus generating the string:

#+begin_src
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[2];
 creg c[2];
h q[0];
x q[1];
y q[0];
z q[1];
cx q[0], q[1];
measure q[0] -> c[1]
#+end_src

To save the generated code in a file, the function ~(defun create-openqasm-file (qc file-path)~ must be called.

*** Example of Deutsch-Josza's algorithm implementation:

#+begin_src lisp
;; Deutsch-Josza Algrithm Implementation

;; Oracle f(x) = 0
(defun oracle-f1 ()
  )

;; Oracle f(x) = 1

(defun oracle-f2 (qc)
  (cl-quantum:xgate qc 1))

;; Oracle f(x) = x
(defun oracle-f3 (qc)
  (cl-quantum:cnotgate qc 0 1))

;; Oracle f(x) = 1 - x

(defun oracle-f4 (qc)
  (progn
    (cl-quantum:cnotgate qc 0 1)
    (cl-quantum:xgate qc 1)))


(defconstant  +QREG+ (cl-quantum:make-qregister 2 "q"))
(defconstant  +CREG+ (cl-quantum:make-cregister 1 "c"))

(defun run ()
  (let ((qc   (cl-quantum:make-qcircuit +QREG+ +CREG+)))
    (progn
      (cl-quantum:xgate qc 1)
      (cl-quantum:hgate qc 0)
      (cl-quantum:hgate qc 1)
      (oracle-f2 qc)
      (cl-quantum:hgate qc 0)
      (cl-quantum:measure qc 0 0)
      (cl-quantum:create-openqasm qc ""))))
#+end_src

** Installation

In your new project add the package as a dependency or in REPL run ~(ql:quickload "cl-quantum")~.
