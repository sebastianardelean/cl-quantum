# clq

## Usage

**clq** is a package that allows the definition and development of quantum circuits in Common Lisp and to export them to **OpenQASM v2.0**.

The following code presents an example that initializes a quantum circuit made of one 2-qubits quantum register and one 2-bits classical register.
We apply on the circuit Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z and CNOT gates.

```
 (defvar qreg (make-qregister 2 "q"))
  (defvar creg (make-cregister 2 "c"))
  (defvar qc (make-qcircuit (list qreg) (list creg)))
  (hgate qc qreg 0)
  (xgate qc qreg 1)
  (ygate qc qreg 0)
  (zgate qc qreg 1)
  (cxgate qc qreg 0 qreg 1)
  (measure qc qreg 0 creg 1)

```

To generate the **OpenQASM v2.0** is enough to call the function `(generate-openqasm qc "")`, thus generating the string:

```
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[2];
 creg c[2];
h q[0];
x q[1];
y q[0];
z q[1];
cx q[0], q[1];
measure q[0] -> c[1]
```

To save the generated code in a file, the function `(defun save-openqasm-to-file (qc file-path)` must be called.

### Example of Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm implementation:

```
;; Deutsch-Jozaa Algrithm Implementation

;; Oracle f(x) = 0
(defun oracle-f1 ()
  )

;; Oracle f(x) = 1

(defun oracle-f2 (qc qr)
  (clq:xgate qc qr 1))

;; Oracle f(x) = x
(defun oracle-f3 (qc cqr tqr)
  (clq:cnotgate qc cqr 0 tqr 1))

;; Oracle f(x) = 1 - x

(defun oracle-f4 (qc cqr tqr)
  (progn
    (clq:cnotgate qc cqr 0 tqr 1)
    (clq:xgate qc cqr 1)))


(defconstant  +QREG+ (clq:make-qregister 2 "q"))
(defconstant  +CREG+ (clq:make-cregister 1 "c"))

(defun run ()
  (let ((qc   (clq:make-qcircuit (list +QREG+) (list +CREG+))))
    (progn
      (clq:xgate qc +QREG+ 1)
      (clq:hgate qc +QREG+ 0)
      (clq:hgate qc +QREG+ 1)
      (oracle-f2 qc +QREG+)
      (clq:hgate qc +QREG+ 0)
      (clq:measure qc +QREG+ 0 +CREG+ 0)
      (clq:generate-openqasm qc ""))))
```

## Installation

In your new project add the package as a dependency or in REPL run `(ql:quickload "clq")`.
